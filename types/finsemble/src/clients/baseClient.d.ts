 * <h2>Base Client</h2>
 * The Base Client is inherited by every client to provide common functionality to the clients. Clients communicate their status to each other through the Router and receive service status from the service manager. Once all dependencies are met, either client or service, the client's `onReady` method is fired.
 *
 * We're currently halfway through migrating our clients from extending a normal function prototype to an ES6 class.
 * "_BaseClient" represents the new class, while "BaseClient" is the original function. When the migration is complete,
 * we will remove the old function and rename "_BaseClient" to "BaseClient".
