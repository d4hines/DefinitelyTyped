 * <h2>Drag and Drop Client (Finsemble Workspaces)</h2>
 *
 * The Drag and Drop Client acts as an API to share data between components via a user action i.e., drag and drop.
 * As an example, consider a user wanting to share a chart inside a chat - they can do so using the Drag and Drop Service.
 *
 *
 * A component that shares data needs to publish the data types it can share by calling `setEmitters`.
 * The Window Manager automatically adds a draggable share icon to any component that calls `setEmitters`.
 * Similarly, a component that can receive data needs to publish that using `addReceivers`.
 * Since it is possible to have multiple components on a page receiving the data, you can add multiple receivers for the same data `type`.
 *
 * The Drag and Drop Client overlays a scrim on all windows once the user starts dragging a sharable item. The scrim displays which windows can and cannot receive that data.
 * However, this doesn't always work well, especially with complex third party components. You may need to add your own drop zone to the component and use `drop` as the handler.
 *
 * The Drag and Drop Client can also make use of the Linker Client to share data between linked windows using `openSharedData`.
 *
 * For more information, see the [Drag and Drop tutorial](tutorial-DragAndDropSharing.html).
