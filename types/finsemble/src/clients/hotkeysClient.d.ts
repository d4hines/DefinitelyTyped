 * <h2>Hotkey Client (Finsemble Flow)</h2>
 *
 * This module contains the Hotkey Client, used for registering hotkey combinations and their respective handler functions with Finsemble.
 *
 * The client can handle two types of hotkeys: **local hotkeys**, for which the handlers will only fire when the window which defined the hotkey is in focus, and **global hotkeys**, which will fire regardless of what window is in focus.
 *
 * For more information, see the [Hotkey tutorial](tutorial-Hotkeys.html).
