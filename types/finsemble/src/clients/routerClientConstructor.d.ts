 * <h2>Router Client</h2>
 *
 * The Router Client sends and receives event messages between Finsemble components and services. See the <a href=tutorial-TheRouter.html>Router tutorial</a> for an overview of the Router's functionality.
 *
 * Router callbacks for incoming messages are **always** in the form `callback(error, event)`. If `error` is null, then the incoming data is always in `event.data`. If `error` is set, it contains a diagnostic object and message. On error, the `event` parameter is not undefined.
 *

 * @publishedName RouterClient
 * @param {string} clientName router base client name for human readable messages (window name is concatenated to baseClientName)
 * @param {string=} transportName router transport name, currently either "SharedWorker" or "IPCBus" (usually this is auto-configured internally but can be selected for testing or special configurations)
