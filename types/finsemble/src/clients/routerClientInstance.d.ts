 * Example:

 *	// get a shared instance of RouterClient (shared within the containing component or service)
 *	var RouterClient = require('./routerClientInstance').default;
 *
 * @namespace routerClientInstance
 * @shouldBePublished false

 * RouterClient and Logger be ready. If RouterClient is NOT required before
 * the Logger, then this file will be dynamically required at Logger.start().
