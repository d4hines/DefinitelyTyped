 * Small class to hold on to dependencies and callbacks. Also emits a timeout event that the startupManager is listening for. When it times out, the startupManager catches the event and generates a message that includes all of the offline clients and services. It then causes this class to emit an  err event that the baseService is listening for. This arrangement is set up for a couple of reasons.
 * 1. I can't use the logger in here because the logger uses the startupManager, and there'd be a circular dependency.
 * 2. FSBLDependencyManager is a singleton, and there can be multiple services living in a single window. I didn't want them all to log that they were offline if they weren't (e.g., if I'd put the emitter on the StartupManager instead of this class).
