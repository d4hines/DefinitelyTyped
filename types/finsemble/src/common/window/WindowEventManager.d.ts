 * The reason I want this to exist is so that the windows don't have to worry about subscribing to and unsubscribing from events. This object will handle all event subscription/emission for the pubic and private window implementations.
 *
 * It will be capable of listening for remote events and triggering local events to match. It will handle router cleanup, and should narrow down the places that we have to look when an event isn't firing properly.
 *
 * Outside of the windowService, events can be listened for by simply calling:
 * finsembleWindow.addListener(event, handler);
 *
 * finsembleWindow.addListener will call finsembleWindow.WindowEventManager.listenForRemoteEvent();
 *
 * The private window implementations will use the proxyEventsForWindow method in order to distribute events to remote wraps.
