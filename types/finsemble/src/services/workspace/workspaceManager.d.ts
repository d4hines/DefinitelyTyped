/**
 * Static class for interacting with workspace storage.
 *
 * WorkspaceManager is an ORM-like interface into the storage
 * service as it pertains to workspaces. It enforces consistency
 * and our business logic around workspaces; as such, all
 * interactions with storage pertaining to workspace should
 * be run through this class.
 *
 * WorkspaceManager provides three kinds of functions:
 * a) functions for dealing with individual workspaces (such as adding windows,
 * setting the group data, etc.)
 * b) functions for working on the set of workspaces (adding workspaces,
 * removing, renaming, etc.)
 * c) functions for dealing with a special workspace called the active workspace,
 * which gets its own location and storage, and has a special isDirty property
 * that is handled by the WorkspaceManager.
 *
 * All three of these are similar and coupled enough to warrant handling in
 * the same class; but the WorkspaceManager should never grow beyond this scope.
 *
 * DH 3/11/2019
 * Because the class is static, it could technically be safely
 * imported and used from anywhere; however, at present, only
 * the workspace service uses the manager, and it will likely
 * stay this way until Workspaces are stored in a reactive store
 * like the upcoming Persistent Store.
 *
 * A Note on Performance:
 * WorkspaceManager doesn't cache anything, which necessitates many
 * round trips to the StorageService despite no changes in data. In
 * my own testing, I haven't seen this to be an issue; however, if
 * client's storage implementation is very slow, it could feasibly
 * create some drag (though I doubt it would  be the bottleneck). At
 * the cost of added complexity, a caching mechanism could be added
 * overtop the functions without changing their API. However, I think
 * a reactive store like the Persistent store is a better answer to
 * this problem - it's simpler (no extra caching logic specific to
 * workspaces), more flexible (provides new ways for clients to
 * interact with the data), and more performant (entirely push based,
 * instead of pull).
